This webapp uses data from city open data to display interesting facts about a city. The webapp is complete in that it
can store, update, and display facts from multiple cities. However, each fact has to be "hand crafted", which is a mighty
pain in the ass. That said, the project's work-in-progress is finding a way to generate interesting facts. That effort
was started but not finished. The work for the effort is in datasets.rake. See the TODO comments in that file and its
associated files to see where the work was left off.

# README

This sample webapp uses [Chicago's open data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to display interesting facts about the city.
It is designed to store, update, and display facts from multiple cities concurrently but as of now only deals with Chicago.
As a sample the webapp is intended to show some my preferred techniques and tooling.

A running version of this webapp can be found at [http://funfactschicago.com](http://funfactschicago.com)

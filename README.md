# README

This is a sample Rails app meant to show the preferred techniques and tooling of [Chris Stump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscstump).
It uses [Chicago's open data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to display interesting facts about the city. Although
designed to store, update, and display facts from multiple cities concurrently as of now it only deals with Chicago.

## In Action

A running version of this webapp can be found at [http://funfactschicago.com](http://funfactschicago.com)

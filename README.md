# README

This is a sample Rails app meant to show [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscstump) preferred development techniques
and tooling. The app is designed to store, update, and display interesting facts about cities. Currently it only knows
about [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). Facts are generated using [Socrata Open Data APIs](https://dev.socrata.com).

## In Action

When the app is running (with fake data) it looks like this:

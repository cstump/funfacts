# README

This is a sample Rails app meant to show the preferred development techniques and tooling of [Chris Stump](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscstump).
The app is designed to store, update, and display interesting facts about cities. Currently it only knows about Chicago
through [the city's open data project](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).

## In Action

A running version of this webapp can be found at [http://funfactschicago.com](http://funfactschicago.com)

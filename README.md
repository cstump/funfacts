# README

This is a sample Rails app meant to show [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscstump) preferred development techniques and tooling.
The app is designed to store, update, and display interesting facts about cities. Currently it only knows about [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). Facts are generated using [Socrata Open Data APIs](https://dev.socrata.com).

## In Action

A running version of this webapp can be found at [http://funfactschicago.com](http://funfactschicago.com).
